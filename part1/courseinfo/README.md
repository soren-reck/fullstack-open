# Part 1.a: Introduction to React
## Exercises 1.1 - 1.2

(Note: The exercises in this part are done in the courseinfo folder, and only the final state is saved. Exercise 1.2 builds upon the work done in exercise 1.1)

Exercise 1.1: Refactor given code displaying course info that was previously only in one component so that it consists of three new components: Header, Content, and Total.

Exercise 1.2: Refactor the Content component so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead, it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.
